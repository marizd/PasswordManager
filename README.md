 Integration Test Instructions 

These tests validate the main flow of the password manager (register, login, add/retrieve passwords).

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Run the test:
   python test_integration.py

   Will ask for an email for MFA. You can enter any email, as it will simulate and run everything else for you. 

This will simulate a user registering, logging in, and saving/retrieving a password.
